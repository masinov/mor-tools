**Internal Dependencies:**
- Directly depends on `model\constructors.py` (line 18), suggesting it extends or works closely with core constructor functionality
- Part of the `model` package, indicating it provides specialized tooling for model construction

**External Dependencies:**
- **ortools.sat.python**: Primary dependency - provides constraint programming and SAT solver capabilities from Google OR-Tools
- **typing**: Used extensively for type annotations, indicating strong type safety focus

**Integration Patterns:**
- Acts as a specialized utility layer for model construction, likely providing advanced constraint formulation or optimization tools
- Integrates with OR-Tools SAT solver for constraint satisfaction problems
- Serves as an extension point for the core constructors, providing additional construction capabilities
- Pattern suggests this module handles complex constraint logic while `constructors.py` manages basic model structure
