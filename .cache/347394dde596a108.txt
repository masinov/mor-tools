**Primary Purpose:** This file provides serialization/deserialization capabilities for an enhanced CP-SAT model, allowing complete model persistence to disk and restoration with full metadata preservation.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Exporting complete model state (proto + metadata) to ZIP archives containing both binary and JSON data
- Importing and reconstructing models from saved files with full object consistency
- Converting OR-Tools objects to JSON-serializable primitives and back
- Creating clean solving models with only enabled constraints and objectives
- Managing variable mapping and expression translation between model instances

**Architecture Role:** Serves as a persistence layer and I/O utility module for the enhanced CP-SAT modeling system. It acts as a bridge between the high-level modeling interface and the underlying OR-Tools infrastructure, enabling model checkpointing, sharing, and debugging capabilities.

**Notable Patterns:**
- **Composite Pattern:** Handles serialization/deserialization of complex expression trees through recursive processing
- **Adapter Pattern:** Translates between OR-Tools native objects and JSON-serializable representations
- **Factory Pattern:** Recreates constraints and objectives dynamically using metadata and reflection
- **Strategy Pattern:** Different serialization/deserialization methods for various OR-Tools object types
- **Metadata Preservation:** Maintains Python-side consistency through comprehensive metadata storage alongside the raw proto
