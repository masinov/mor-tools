**Internal Dependencies:**
- Depends on `model\debug.py` (likely for logging/debugging utilities)
- The number "2" suggests this is the second dependency, possibly indicating a specific import pattern or version requirement

**External Dependencies:**
- **ortools.sat.python.cp_model**: Primary dependency for constraint programming and optimization (Google OR-Tools CP-SAT solver)
- **typing**: Extensive use of type hints for function signatures and data structures
- **__future__**: Likely for Python version compatibility features

**Integration Patterns:**
- **Constraint Definition Hub**: Acts as a central module for defining optimization constraints using OR-Tools
- **Type-Safe Interface**: Heavy typing suggests it provides well-defined interfaces for other modules to interact with constraint logic
- **Debug Integration**: Integrates with debugging utilities to log constraint violations or optimization progress
- **Solver Abstraction**: Likely wraps OR-Tools functionality with application-specific constraints and validation logic
- **Configuration-Driven**: Probably designed to accept constraint configurations from other modules rather than hardcoding business rules
