**Internal Dependencies:**
- Directly imports `variables`, `constraints`, and `objectives` from the same `model` package, indicating tight coupling with these core modeling components
- Depends on `debug` and `io` modules, suggesting this is a central orchestration module that handles model construction, debugging, and input/output operations
- Serves as the main entry point that coordinates variable creation, constraint application, and objective definition

**External Dependencies:**
- `ortools.sat.python.cp_model`: Primary external dependency for constraint programming, providing the core CP-SAT solver capabilities
- This module acts as a wrapper/interface layer between the internal modeling components and Google's OR-Tools framework

**Integration Patterns:**
- **Orchestrator Pattern:** Acts as the central coordinator that brings together variables, constraints, and objectives to build complete optimization models
- **Facade Pattern:** Provides a simplified interface to the complex OR-Tools CP-SAT model, abstracting internal implementation details
- **Builder Pattern:** Likely constructs optimization models incrementally by aggregating components from the dependent modules
- This module serves as the main integration point where domain-specific modeling logic meets the general-purpose solver infrastructure
