**Internal Dependencies:** None - This module has no dependencies on other files in the codebase.

**External Dependencies:**
- `ortools.sat.python.cp_model`: Core dependency for constraint programming, providing the CP-SAT solver and modeling objects (variables, constraints, objective functions)
- `typing`: Used for type annotations to improve code clarity and maintainability

**Integration Patterns:**
This module serves as a pure utility/helper module focused on objective function construction. It likely:
- Provides factory functions or classes that create objective expressions for optimization problems
- Returns `cp_model` objective objects that can be directly set on CP-SAT model instances
- Follows a stateless pattern - functions take model and parameters, return objective expressions
- Acts as a standalone component that can be called by any optimization service needing objective definitions
- Enables separation of objective logic from core model building and solving infrastructure
