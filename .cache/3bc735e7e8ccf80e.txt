**Internal Dependencies:** None - This module appears to be a standalone utility for model I/O operations with no dependencies on other files in the codebase.

**External Dependencies:**
- `ortools.sat.python.cp_model` & `ortools.sat`: Google OR-Tools constraint programming library for loading and working with CP-SAT models
- `json`: For serializing/deserializing model data
- `zipfile`: For compressed model storage/retrieval
- `typing`: For type annotations and static type checking

**Integration Patterns:** This module serves as a **serialization facade** that encapsulates model persistence logic. It likely provides:
- Save/load functionality for OR-Tools CP-SAT models with metadata
- ZIP-based packaging of models with associated configuration/data
- JSON serialization for human-readable model representation
- Type-safe interfaces for model exchange between components

The module acts as a **boundary object** between the optimization engine and storage systems, abstracting the complexity of model serialization while maintaining type safety through extensive typing annotations.
