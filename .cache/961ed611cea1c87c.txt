**Primary Purpose:** This file provides a mixin class that extends OR-Tools CP-SAT models with helper methods for creating common constraint patterns and boolean variables, keeping the implementation separate from the core model class.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Creates boolean variables representing comparison constraints (greater/less than, equal/not equal)
- Implements logical operations (AND, OR) as boolean variables
- Handles interval-related constraints (point in interval, overlap, containment)
- Provides subject-to constraints that conditionally apply based on boolean markers
- Acts as a facade pattern for underlying constructor functions

**Architecture Role:** This is a utility module that enhances the core OR-Tools CP-SAT functionality. It serves as an extension mechanism (via mixin) rather than a core component, allowing for cleaner separation of concerns while providing syntactic sugar for common constraint patterns.

**Notable Patterns:**
- **Mixin Pattern:** The `EnhancedConstructorsMixin` class is designed to be inherited by model classes to add functionality
- **Facade Pattern:** Wraps multiple standalone constructor functions into a unified interface
- **Consistent API:** All methods follow similar signatures with `self`, input parameters, and `name` for the resulting variable
- **Type Hints:** Uses typing annotations for better code documentation and IDE support
- **External Implementation:** The actual logic is implemented elsewhere (imported functions), keeping this as a clean interface layer
