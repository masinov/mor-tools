**Primary Purpose:** This file provides a rich wrapper around OR-Tools CP-SAT variables with metadata tracking and enhanced variable creation capabilities, extending the base CpModel functionality.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Creating and managing different types of constraint programming variables (IntVar, BoolVar, IntervalVar, OptionalIntervalVar)
- Maintaining variable metadata and registry through VariableInfo class
- Providing expression mapping utilities for variable remapping between models
- Ensuring proper variable initialization and mix-in safety
- Handling constant creation with unique naming

**Architecture Role:** This serves as a core extension module that enhances the OR-Tools CP-SAT model with additional functionality. It acts as a mixin class (_VariablesMixin) designed to be composed with the base CpModel, providing metadata tracking and advanced variable management capabilities.

**Notable Patterns:**
- **Mixin Pattern:** _VariablesMixin extends _cp.CpModel functionality without traditional inheritance
- **Lazy Initialization:** _ensure_variables() method for on-demand registry setup
- **Factory Methods:** Multiple New*Var methods following a consistent creation pattern
- **Visitor Pattern:** _deep_map_expr implements recursive expression traversal for variable remapping
- **Metadata Attachment:** VariableInfo class stores creation context alongside OR-Tools variables
- **Expression Processing:** Comprehensive handling of linear expressions with GetVar, GetVars, and WeightedSum operations
