**Internal Dependencies:**
- Directly depends on `model\constraints.py` (with a weight of 10, indicating strong coupling)
- Likely uses constraint definitions and utilities from the constraints module
- Part of the model layer, suggesting integration with other model components

**External Dependencies:**
- **ortools.sat.python.cp_model**: Core dependency for constraint programming and SAT solving
- **random**: Used for generating test data or randomizing debug scenarios
- **typing**: Extensive type hinting usage (imported 5 times), indicating strong type safety focus

**Integration Patterns:**
- **Debug/Testing Utility**: Functions as a debugging module for constraint models
- **Model Validation**: Likely validates constraint implementations from `constraints.py`
- **Solution Analysis**: Probably analyzes and verifies CP-SAT model solutions
- **Development Tool**: Serves as a development aid rather than production code, providing verification and diagnostic capabilities for the constraint programming system
