**Primary Purpose:** This file provides debugging and introspection utilities for constraint programming models, specifically focused on identifying infeasibility causes through Minimal Infeasible Subset (MIS) detection and model analysis.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Debug infeasible models by finding minimal sets of constraints to disable
- Provide comprehensive model summaries and validation diagnostics
- Enable constraint introspection by type, tag, and status (enabled/disabled)
- Create relaxed model copies by randomly disabling constraints
- Generate subset models with specific constraint configurations
- Manage constraint state tracking and validation

**Architecture Role:** This serves as a diagnostic utility layer for constraint programming models, extending the base CP model functionality with debugging capabilities. It acts as a mixin class (`_DebugMixin`) that enhances model objects with introspection and debugging features without modifying core solving logic.

**Notable Patterns:**
- **Mixin Pattern:** Uses inheritance to extend `_cp.CpModel` with debugging capabilities while maintaining separation of concerns
- **Constraint State Management:** Implements sophisticated tracking of enabled/disabled constraints through boolean variables and state dictionaries
- **Model Cloning:** Uses `clone()` pattern to create modified copies for debugging without affecting original models
- **Lazy Evaluation:** `_ensure_constraints()` method suggests deferred constraint processing or validation
- **Visitor Pattern Elements:** Methods like `get_constraints_by_type()` and `get_constraints_by_tag()` provide filtered views of model components
- **Diagnostic Interface:** Unified API for model analysis through summary, validation, and constraint information methods
