## Module Purpose
This module provides `EnhancedCpModel`, a drop-in replacement for Google OR-Tools' `CpModel` with enhanced functionality including debugging capabilities, model cloning, and input/output operations. It extends the base constraint programming model with rich tracking of variables, constraints, and objectives.

## Public API

### EnhancedCpModel Class

**Usage pattern:**
```python
from model.model import EnhancedCpModel

model = EnhancedCpModel()
# Use as a regular CpModel but with enhanced features
x = model.new_int_var(0, 10, 'x')
model.add(x <= 5)
```

**Method signatures:**

- `__init__(self) -> None`: Initializes the enhanced model, inheriting from all mixins and the base CpModel.

- `clear_model(self) -> None`: Resets everything including OR-Tools proto, Python registries, and counters. Called internally by import/clone operations.

**Dependencies:**
- Requires `ortools.sat.python.cp_model` (aliased as `_cp`)
- Inherits from multiple mixins: `_VariablesMixin`, `_ConstraintsMixin`, `_ObjectivesMixin`, `_DebugMixin`, `_IOMixin`

**Return types:**
- Constructor returns an `EnhancedCpModel` instance
- `clear_model()` returns `None`

## Cross-References

**Imports from other modules:**
- `_VariablesMixin` from `model.variables` - Provides enhanced variable management
- `_ConstraintsMixin` from `model.constraints` - Provides enhanced constraint tracking
- `_ObjectivesMixin` from `model.objectives` - Provides objective function management
- `_DebugMixin` from `model.debug` - Provides debugging capabilities
- `_IOMixin` from `model.io` - Provides import/export functionality
- `CpModel` from `ortools.sat.python.cp_model` - Base constraint programming model

**Exports to other modules:**
- `EnhancedCpModel` is the main export and would be imported by application code
- The mixin classes are designed specifically for this composite class

**Potential issues:**
- The module uses relative imports (`model.variables`, `model.constraints`, etc.) which may cause issues if the package structure changes
- Multiple inheritance from several mixins could lead to method name conflicts
- The `clear_model()` method directly manipulates `__dict__` which is fragile

## Integration Examples

**Basic usage with enhanced debugging:**
```python
from model.model import EnhancedCpModel

model = EnhancedCpModel()
x = model.new_int_var(0, 10, 'x')
y = model.new_int_var(0, 10, 'y')
model.add(x + y == 10)

# Enhanced debugging capabilities
print(f"Variables created: {model._variable_counter}")
print(f"Constraints created: {model._constraint_counter}")

# Clear and reuse model
model.clear_model()
```

**Integration with OR-Tools solver:**
```python
from model.model import EnhancedCpModel
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

model = EnhancedCpModel()
# Build model using enhanced features
x = model.new_int_var(0, 10, 'x')
model.maximize(x)

# Use standard OR-Tools solver
solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
status = solver.solve(model)  # EnhancedCpModel is compatible with base CpModel

# Access enhanced debugging info
if status == cp_model.OPTIMAL:
    print(f"Solution: {solver.value(x)}")
    print(f"Model stats: {model.get_model_stats()}")  # Assuming _DebugMixin provides this
```

**Model cloning and serialization:**
```python
from model.model import EnhancedCpModel

# Create and populate a model
model1 = EnhancedCpModel()
x = model1.new_int_var(0, 10, 'x')
model1.add(x >= 5)

# Clone the model (assuming _IOMixin provides cloning)
model2 = model1.clone()  # Creates identical copy with fresh state

# Export model (assuming _IOMixin provides export)
model_data = model1.export_to_dict()  # Serialize model state
```

The `EnhancedCpModel` maintains full compatibility with the base `CpModel` while adding rich tracking and management capabilities through its mixin composition.
