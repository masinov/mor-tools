**Internal Dependencies:** None - This file has no dependencies on other files within the codebase.

**External Dependencies:**
- `ortools.sat.python.cp_model`: Core dependency for constraint programming, providing the `CpModel` class for defining optimization models and variables
- `typing`: Used for type annotations (List, Optional, Union) to enhance code clarity and maintainability

**Integration Patterns:**
This module serves as a **variable factory/utility layer** for OR-Tools constraint programming. It likely:
- Creates and manages CP-SAT model variables with consistent configurations
- Provides typed wrapper functions around `model.NewIntVar()` and similar methods
- Standardizes variable creation patterns across the codebase
- Returns properly typed variable objects for use in constraint definitions elsewhere

The module acts as a **pure utility** - it doesn't maintain state but provides functions that other constraint/model building modules would call to instantiate variables consistently.
