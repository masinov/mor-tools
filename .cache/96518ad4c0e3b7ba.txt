**Internal Dependencies:**
- Strong dependency on `model\constructor_tools.py` (15 imports), indicating this module likely provides core utility functions and base classes for constructor operations
- Part of a constructor-focused subsystem within the model layer

**External Dependencies:**
- **ortools.sat.python**: Primary dependency for constraint programming and optimization (likely for scheduling, resource allocation, or combinatorial problems)
- **typing**: Extensive type hinting usage suggests strong emphasis on type safety and interface definition

**Integration Patterns:**
- **Utility Consumer**: Heavily relies on constructor_tools for shared functionality and abstractions
- **OR-Tools Integration Layer**: Acts as a bridge between the application's constructor concepts and Google's OR-Tools constraint programming framework
- **Type-Driven Interface**: Extensive typing suggests this module defines clear contracts for constructor operations that other modules must adhere to
- **Specialized Constructor Factory**: Likely provides various constructor implementations that leverage OR-Tools for complex constraint satisfaction problems
