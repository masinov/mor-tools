**Primary Purpose:** This file implements an enhanced wrapper class for Google OR-Tools' CP-SAT model that extends the base CpModel with additional functionality for debugging, cloning, and I/O operations.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Provides a drop-in replacement for `CpModel` with extended capabilities
- Combines multiple mixins for variables, constraints, objectives, debugging, and I/O functionality
- Manages internal state clearing through the `clear_model()` method
- Maintains separate registries for variables, constraints, and objectives

**Architecture Role:** This serves as a core facade/adapter component that sits between the OR-Tools library and the application code, providing enhanced functionality while maintaining compatibility with the original API. It acts as a central coordination point that aggregates multiple specialized mixins.

**Notable Patterns:**
- **Multiple Inheritance/Mixin Pattern:** Uses multiple inheritance to combine functionality from specialized mixin classes (`_VariablesMixin`, `_ConstraintsMixin`, etc.)
- **Facade Pattern:** Provides a simplified interface to complex OR-Tools functionality while adding custom features
- **Registry Pattern:** Maintains separate internal registries (`_variables`, `_constraints`, `_objectives`) for tracking model components
- **Composition over Inheritance:** While using inheritance, it delegates to the underlying `_cp.CpModel` instance rather than replacing its functionality entirely
